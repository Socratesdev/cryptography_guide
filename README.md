This is a directiry where I go through a book on cryptography and use code to understand it better. I will write programs that emulate the making and breaking of these codes to understand them better. If possible I would also want to incorporate some form of visualisation for the programs but that will be done at a very latter date. 

The program has a readme file that you are reading right now? Then their is the main.h file where it imports everything in the github repository and then their is the the alphabet.h file that has the alphabet in an array to be able to call it and some other background things that are not the algorithms for the breaking algorithms. 

To compile these programs using the bash script I have made use
{ compilecpp.sh [code file] [executable name] }
